### First push: 
    - Implementation fo basic pointnav classes in the code
    - Addition of in-context examples for pointnav
    - The code runs for one iteration

### Second Push:
    - Implement loops if navigation fails (done)
    - Modify input string to allow for multiple while loops, e.g. NAV0 + NAV1 (DONE)
    - The while loop now works only for the first NAV0, ad the options that if NAV0 is accomplished end_episode has to be true also for NAV1
    - Adding part for objectnav --> DETECT class, while loop
